### Building an LLM app using golang  
This repository provides a tool for building LLM apps similar to LangChain, but implemented in golang.  
Currently, there are two ways to use this library:  
1. [create a pipeline](examples/normal): compose a pipeline using components like parsers, LLMs, templates, etc.  
2. [use the agent](examples/agent): run the pipeline combined with other functions such as search.  
  
Please note that this library is a hobby project and there are no plans for ongoing development or improvements.
